## Description
Cap for the top of a Monoprice Workstream 43450 Monitor Mount pole.

Parameterized model for a Monoprice Workstream monitor mount.

The monitor mount comes with a grommet with a hole in the center, which allows cables to be routed through the mounting post.

I only had one single wire for my USB Webcam, so I didn't want the large gap opened.
 
This cap will fill in the space, and can be customized to easily accommodate more or fewer cables.
